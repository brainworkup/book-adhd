    "text": "Treatment options for ADHD typically include a combination of behavioral techniques, consideration of stimulant medication, environmental organization, and the maintenance of a long-term perspective of ADHD as a chronic condition. (ref:first-name)’s parents may wish to discuss whether medical treatment of (ref:first-name)’s symptoms is indicated with (ref:his-her) pediatrician. In (ref:first-name)’s specific case, a methylphenidate preparation at low-to-medium dosage preparation may be the best choice of medication to address both (ref:his-her) inattentiveness and impulsiveness.\nEducational Therapist An educational therapist or related tutor or reading specialist can help (ref:first-name) learn how to better manage (ref:his-her) school demands, attention/executive difficulties, and work with (ref:him-her) on reading. The Association of Educational Therapists is a resource for finding educational therapists, or this provider can make recommendations.\nReferral for speech/language evaluation is recommended to assess broader speech articulation concerns and language development.\nReferral for occupational therapy is recommended to assess fine and gross motor development and executive functioning."

    "section": "2.2 Recommendations for School",
    "text": "2.2 Recommendations for School\n\n(ref:first-name)’s parents are encouraged to share the current report with the personnel at (ref:first-name)’s school to initiate an IEP evaluation and to integrate the current findings and recommendations for (ref:him-her) reading disability and ADHD.\n(ref:first-name)’s need for educational assistance focuses upon (ref:him-her) need for a skills trainer/monitor at school. Arrange for (ref:first-name) to have regularly scheduled times to check-in with this individual, ideally at the beginning and end of each week, and possibly for a brief period of time during each day. This individual should serve as a liaison between (ref:first-name) and (ref:him-her) teachers, and all teachers and school personnel should report progress and concerns to this person on a regular basis. This individual should then assist (ref:first-name) in the development of a plan to address areas of need, including organizational skills, time management, study skills, test taking, etc.\n(ref:first-name) will need a program of intervention that addresses both (ref:him-her) dyslexia as well as (ref:his-her) attention challenges. Each component is a necessary, but not sufficient, part of helping (ref:him-her) to resolve (ref:his-her) difficulties in school. As such, careful attention to (ref:first-name)’s capacity for focused and sustained attention should be paid by (ref:his-her) reading tutors, and consideration given to the potential that she may benefit from a trial of stimulant medication, to determine its effectiveness in assisting (ref:him-her) with learning to read.\nClassroom seating (ref:first-name) should be provided as minimally distracting a seating placement as possible. Although this recommendation is generally considered to imply the front of the class, each environment should be reviewed to maximize (ref:his-her) ability to focus upon the task at hand, while reducing peripheral distractions. Many students with ADHD find that listening to soft background music while they study is actually helpful.\nVerbal instruction Because (ref:first-name) has difficulties with attention, she will invariably miss details of verbal instruction. Thus, her teacher(s) should be explicit in instructions with her, making sure she truly understands what is expected of her on a given task or assignment. (ref:first-name) should be asked to repeat commands to ensure proper comprehension, and attempts should be made to provide praise/positive reinforcement following instances of proper execution.\nProvide anticipatory guidance as to upcoming events, assignments, and projects that are due. Help (ref:first-name) to begin to use a day planner or calendar, and to prepare for upcoming requirements. Cue (ref:him-her) (and the rest of the class), ten minutes before the end of class periods, to finish up (ref:his-her) work, write down (ref:his-her) assignments, and perform any other tasks. (ref:first-name) may need specific assistance in the use of a well-organized notebook and filing system.\n(ref:first-name)’s difficulties with sustained attention suggest the need to break assignments and projects into shorter, sequentially organized steps. Ask (ref:him-her) to complete these “mini assignments” and provide opportunities for feedback and reinforcement at each step. Rather than provide long-term goals and expectations, provide much shorter-term assignments and consequences. Help (ref:first-name) to plan, to use time management strategies, and to self-monitor (ref:his-her) progress. The goal of independence will be achieved when (ref:he-she) is able to consistently perform such activities without help, however at the present time it will be essential for (ref:him-her) to receive this form of assistance.\nAssist (ref:first-name) with appreciating the “big picture” in tasks, prior to (ref:his-her) becoming caught up in the details. Ask (ref:him-her) to restate (in different words) what the task or problem is asking for, and to then develop a plan of how to go about solving the task. As she then takes the individual steps toward problem solution, ask (ref:him-her) to regularly relate them back to the overall plan, and to become better aware of the relationship of (ref:his-her) activities to the goal.\nConsider assigning (ref:first-name) a “study buddy” who can provide (ref:him-her) with copies of notes taken in lecture classes, and with whom she can have telephone/video chat contact if she does not understand or remember aspects of homework assignments.\n(ref:first-name) will respond better to situations that she finds stimulating and engaging. Varying the instructional medium and pace will help sustain interest. (ref:he-she-cap would probably find lessons that emphasize “hands-on” activities more engaging. Keeping the time required for sustained attention on task balanced with learning that is more active will improve performance.\n(ref:first-name) should receive both auditory and visual presentation of material as often as possible, and she should be provided the opportunity to record class lectures on a portable recording device, so that she can utilize the recording to study or do work at home. Combine verbal directions with illustrations or demonstrations of the desired task. The use of multiple modes of instruction increases the probability of successful learning of the task.\n(ref:first-name) tends to lose focus as the day goes on and activity-level may increase during the day. Therefore, schedule the most demanding attention tasks in the morning. Along with breaking up the need for sustaining attention for a long period, (ref:first-name) would do better when allowed frequent breaks to move around inside and outside the classroom.\n(ref:first-name) may get overwhelmed with large assignments. Adjust the assignment down to smaller intervals, give the assignment one sheet at a time, or assign every third problem, rather than every one. Schedule breaks after an optimum attention time period and then return to the assignment. And emphasize that part of the work routine is to “check your work.” Students tend to complete work and turn it in without checking it over. Give (ref:first-name) some instruction in how to check work and practice it with (ref:him-her).\nMake sure that (ref:first-name) establishes eye contact when receiving direction/instruction. This will improve understanding and follow-through on the task. And after giving (ref:first-name) directions, have (ref:him-her) paraphrase what the teacher has said. This will increase comprehension and provide an opportunity to check for understanding. This should be done at home, too.\nCompleting schoolwork and maintaining behavior during the school day can be exhausting experiences. Large homework loads on a regular basis can become discouraging and very stressful for parents as well. Attempt to have homework reduced, if possible, and limited to guided practice on material that (ref:first-name) has begun to master. Attempt to break down long-term assignments into steps to lessen (ref:first-name) feeling overwhelmed. Consider having (ref:him-her) complete every third problem instead of answering each one. Emphasize practice and assignment completion on the word processor to lower the frustration many students feel with written work.\nEmphasize accuracy over speed by providing separate grades for these skills on assignments, increasing the amount of time that (ref:first-name) has to complete in-class assignments so that she does not feel rushed; teach (ref:him-her) strategies to check over (ref:his-her) work including before (i.e., coding multiplication problems in orange on (ref:his-her) math worksheet) and after she completes it (i.e., checking the accuracy of (ref:his-her) responses). (ref:he-she-cap) is encouraged to proofread (ref:his-her) tests for errors and mistakes.\n(ref:first-name) will benefit from taking tests in a small, structured setting outside the classroom to reduce distractions and to ease (ref:his-her) stress due to inefficient information processing. (ref:he-she-cap) should apply for and received additional time for exams and standardized exams (time and a half or double time).\nFinally, (ref:first-name) will need external organization of (ref:his-her) efforts, in the form of someone previewing what she is to do, providing commentary and feedback as to what she is doing, and review of (ref:his-her) actions after she has finished. Providing external feedback will assist (ref:him-her) to become more self-aware and reflective."

Recommended sources of information include CHADD and NIMH.\nStudying: It will be helpful for (ref:first-name) to structure (ref:his-her) participation in the learning environment at home in order to maximize (ref:his-her) attention and focus. For example, learning how to work in shorter intervals (with reinforcement following completion of individual task segments, e.g., 15 minutes of social media time) will assist (ref:him-her) in effectively directing (ref:his-her) attention to the information being presented or learned. The environment should be free of clutter and visual and auditory distractions kept to a minimum. (ref:he-she-cap) should turn (ref:his-her) phone off (if she has one) during study sessions to avoid distractions from friends and family members.\nMindfulness is a technique in which (ref:first-name) can learn to ignore distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand. People of all ages can benefit from mindfulness training, which can help them to develop cognitive control. This book and website are good places to start Mindful Parenting for ADHD.\nExtracurricular activities are highly encouraged (yet carefully balanced with (ref:his-her) academic demands) to foster continued positive socialization experiences. As we discussed during feedback, try to find a creative outlet for (ref:first-name) such as art classes—something she will be good at and have success at."
